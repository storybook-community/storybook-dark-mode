# Commit Message Guidelines

This document outlines the standards for writing commit messages in this repository.

## Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

## Type

The type must be one of the following:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
- `ci`: Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
- `chore`: Other changes that don't modify src or test files
- `revert`: Reverts a previous commit

## Scope

The scope is optional and should be the package name or area affected:

- `storybook-dark-mode`: Changes to the main package
- `deps`: Dependency updates
- `config`: Configuration changes

## Subject

The subject should:
- Use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
- Not capitalize the first letter
- No dot (.) at the end
- Be concise but descriptive

## Body

The body is optional and should:
- Provide additional context about the change
- Explain the "why" not the "what"
- Be separated from the subject by a blank line

## Footer

The footer is optional and should:
- Reference issues: `Closes #123`, `Fixes #456`
- Note breaking changes: `BREAKING CHANGE: description`

## Examples

### Simple Feature

```
feat: add dark mode toggle component
```

### Feature with Scope

```
feat(storybook-dark-mode): add theme persistence to localStorage
```

### Bug Fix

```
fix: correct dark mode class application on iframe
```

### Breaking Change

```
feat!: remove DarkModeStore from public exports

BREAKING CHANGE: DarkModeStore is now internal. Use DarkModeParam type instead.
```

### Multi-line Commit

```
feat: add support for custom theme classes

Allow users to specify custom class names for dark and light modes.
This enables better integration with existing CSS frameworks.

Closes #123
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep the subject line under 72 characters
2. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
3. Reference issues and pull requests when applicable
4. Use imperative mood in the subject line
5. Be consistent with scope usage

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works in conjunction with:
- [Commit Summary](.cursor/rules/agents/commit-summary.mdc) - When to include commit messages
- [Generate Changeset](.cursor/rules/workflows/generate-changeset.mdc) - For documenting user-facing changes

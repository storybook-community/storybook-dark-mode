# AI Rules Master Reference

This file serves as the central reference for all AI rules in the repository.

## Table of Contents

- [How to Use](#how-to-use)
- [Locations](#locations)
- [Rule List](#rule-list)

## How to Use

Each rule may contain a section about related rules. You should read the related rules before applying the rule.

## Locations

All rules should be located under folders `.cursor/rules`. They can be placed at the root of the repository (i.e. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`), or under the root of a project in a monorepo (e.g. `<REPOSITORY_ROOT>/.../<PROJECT_ROOT>/.cursor/rules`).

Other `*.mdc` files should not be treated as rule files unless explicitly referenced.

## Rule List

Rules are organized into three main categories:

- **Agents**: Control AI agent behavior and response formatting
- **Guidelines**: Establish best practices and coding standards
- **Workflows**: Provide step-by-step processes for specific tasks

### Agents

Rules for AI agent behavior and management:

- [Commit Summary](.cursor/rules/agents/commit-summary.mdc) - Add a "Commit Message" section in agent response
- [Cursor Rules](.cursor/rules/agents/cursor-rules.mdc) - Rule for managing cursor rules
- [Rule Usage](.cursor/rules/agents/rule-usage.mdc) - Add a "Rules Applied" section in agent response

### Guidelines

Opinionated best practices:

- [Commit Message](.cursor/rules/guidelines/commit-message.mdc) - Generate commit messages
- [Naming](.cursor/rules/guidelines/naming.mdc) - File and folder naming conventions
- [Storybook Stories](.cursor/rules/guidelines/storybook-stories.mdc) - How to write Storybook stories
- [TypeScript](.cursor/rules/guidelines/typescript.mdc) - TypeScript development guidelines

### Workflows

Step-by-step guides for AI tasks:

- [Generate Changeset](.cursor/rules/workflows/generate-changeset.mdc) - Generate changeset files for package versioning and changelog generation

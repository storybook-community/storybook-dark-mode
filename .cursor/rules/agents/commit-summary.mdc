# Commit Summary

This rule ensures that AI agents provide commit message suggestions when making code changes.

## When to Apply

This rule should be applied when:
- Making code changes that should be committed
- Completing a task that modifies files
- Creating new features or fixing bugs

## Implementation

After completing code changes, the AI agent should:

1. Review all modified files
2. Generate an appropriate commit message following the [Commit Message Guidelines](.cursor/rules/guidelines/commit-message.mdc)
3. Add a "Commit Message" section to the response

## Format

The commit message should be formatted as:

```markdown
## Commit Message

```
[commit message following conventional commits format]
```
```

## Example

```markdown
## Commit Message

```
feat: add dark mode toggle component with theme persistence
```
```

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works in conjunction with:
- [Commit Message Guidelines](.cursor/rules/guidelines/commit-message.mdc) - Format and structure of commit messages
- [Rule Usage](.cursor/rules/agents/rule-usage.mdc) - Documenting which rules were applied

# Cursor Rules Guidelines

Guidelines for cursor rules in this repository.

## Table of Contents

- [Rules Categories](#rules-categories)
- [Directory Structure](#directory-structure)
- [Naming Convention](#naming-convention)
- [Rule File Structure](#rule-file-structure)
- [Creating New Rules](#creating-new-rules)

## Rules Categories

Cursor rules can be categorized based on its purpose:

### Agents

**Purposes**: Rules for AI agent behavior and management

**Examples**: Commit Summary, Cursor Rules Guidelines, Rule Usage

**When to use**: For rules that control how the AI agent should behave

### Guidelines

**Purposes**: Opinionated best practices on specific topics

**Examples**: Commit Message, Naming Conventions, Formatting Standards, Coding Style, Best Practices

**When to use**: For rules that establish standards, conventions, or best practices

### Workflow

**Purpose**: Step-by-step guides for the AI agent to perform specific tasks

**Examples**: Implementation workflows, task-specific guidance, process documentation

**When to use**: For rules that describe how to accomplish specific tasks or follow processes

## Directory Structure

Rule files should always be placed in the appropriate subfolder within `PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/`:

```
.cursor/rules/
├── master.mdc # Central reference (special file)
├── agents/ # Rules for AI agent behavior and management.
│   ├── commit-summary.mdc # Add a "Commit Message" section in agent response
│   ├── cursor-rules.mdc # Rule for managing cursor rules
│   └── rule-usage.mdc # Add a "Rules Applied" section in agent response
├── guidelines/ # Opinionated best practices
│   ├── commit-message.mdc
│   ├── naming.mdc
│   └── ...
└── workflows/ # Step-by-step guides for AI tasks
    ├── generate-changeset.mdc
    └── ...
```

## Naming Convention

Follow the naming convention:

- **Use kebab-case** for filenames (e.g., `react-component.mdc`, `commit-message.mdc`)
- **Always use .mdc extension** (not .md or .markdown)
- **Make names descriptive** of the rule's purpose
- **Place in appropriate category subfolder** (see categories above)

### Examples

✅ **Good names:**
- `react-component.mdc`
- `commit-message.mdc`
- `storybook-story.mdc`
- `typescript.mdc`

❌ **Bad names:**
- `ReactComponent.mdc` (PascalCase)
- `react_component.mdc` (snake_case)
- `react-component.md` (wrong extension)
- `component.mdc` (too generic)

## Rule File Structure

### Frontmatter Requirements

Every cursor rule file must begin with frontmatter that defines the rule's metadata:

```yaml
---
description: Short description of the rule's purpose
globs:
alwaysApply: false
---
```

**Frontmatter fields:**

- `description`: Optional brief explanation of what the rule does
- `globs`: Optional file patterns where this rule applies (e.g., `src/**/*.tsx`)
  - **Important**: Complex glob patterns are not supported
  - **Example**: `*.{ts,tsx}` does not work - use `*.ts,*.tsx` instead
  - **Supported**: Simple patterns like `*.ts`, `src/**/*.tsx`, `packages/*/src/**/*.ts`
  - **Not Supported**: Brace expansion patterns like `*.{ts,tsx}`, `*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}`
- `alwaysApply`: Whether the rule should always be applied (usually `false`)

### Content Structure

The cursor rules should follow this structure:

```md
# Rule Title

Brief introduction explaining the rule's purpose and when to apply it.

## Table of Contents
- @Section 1
- @Section 2
- @Examples
- @Integration

## Section 1

Detailed explanation with step-by-step instructions.

### Subsection

More specific guidance with examples.

## Section 2

Additional content organized in logical sections.

## Examples

### Good Examples
[Include positive examples]

### Bad Examples
[Include examples of what to avoid]

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works in conjunction with:
- @Related Rule 1 - Brief explanation
- @Related Rule 2 - Brief explanation
```

### Required Sections

Every rule should include these sections:

1. **Introduction**: Brief explanation of the rule's purpose and when to use it
2. **Table of Contents**: For rules with multiple sections (use anchor links)
3. **Main Content**: Organized in logical sections with clear headings
4. **Examples**: Both good and bad examples when applicable
5. **Integration**: References to related rules and guidelines

## Creating New Rules

Follow this step-by-step process when adding a new rule:

### Step 1: Determine the Category

Choose the [appropriate category](#rules-categories) based on the rule's purpose.

### Step 2: Create the File

1. Navigate to the appropriate subfolder in `.cursor/rules/`
2. Create a new file with a descriptive name in kebab-case
3. Use the `.mdc` extension

### Step 3: Write the Content

Follow the content structure template above, including:
- Clear title and introduction
- Table of contents (if multiple sections)
- Detailed explanations with examples
- Integration section with related rules

### Step 4: Update References

Update `.cursor/rules/master.mdc` with the new rule.

### Step 5: Test the Rule

Ensure the rule works as expected and follows project conventions.

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works in conjunction with:
- **@Master Reference**: Central reference for all rules
- **@Naming Guidelines**: File naming conventions

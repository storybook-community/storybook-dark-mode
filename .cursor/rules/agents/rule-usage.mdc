# Rule Usage

This rule ensures that AI agents document which cursor rules were applied during their work.

## When to Apply

This rule should be applied when:
- Completing a task that involved following specific rules
- Making code changes that required rule guidance
- Creating or modifying files that are covered by rules

## Implementation

After completing a task, the AI agent should:

1. Review which rules were relevant to the work performed
2. List the rules that were actively applied
3. Add a "Rules Applied" section to the response

## Format

The rules applied section should be formatted as:

```markdown
## Rules Applied

- [Rule Name](.cursor/rules/category/rule-name.mdc) - Brief description of how it was used
- [Another Rule](.cursor/rules/category/another-rule.mdc) - Brief description
```

## Example

```markdown
## Rules Applied

- [TypeScript Guidelines](.cursor/rules/guidelines/typescript.mdc) - Used for type safety and code structure
- [Naming Conventions](.cursor/rules/guidelines/naming.mdc) - Followed kebab-case for file naming
- [Commit Message](.cursor/rules/guidelines/commit-message.mdc) - Generated conventional commit message
```

## Integration with Other Rules

This rule works in conjunction with:
- [Commit Summary](.cursor/rules/agents/commit-summary.mdc) - Documenting changes made
- All guideline and workflow rules - Documenting which ones were followed
